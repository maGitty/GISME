\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}


According to \tcite{Li2009}, especially temperature and perceived temperature have a great impact on energy demand. Consequently, several authors combine forecasting energy time series using weather data. They mostly either focus on forecasting \gls{pv} electricity generation as in \tcite{Bofinger2006} and \tcite{Sperati2016} or on electricity generation from wind as in \tcite{Davo2016} and \tcite{Alessandrini2015}.\\

It is notable, that works using station-based data often try to do some sort of geographic interpolation to be able to obtain values for every possible position. Considering this thesis, there is no such problem, as the used grid-based data already provides such distributed values. Thus, when using grid-based data, the step of interpolation can be omitted, and therefore, less effort is required. Some works also regard only forecasting for specific locations or accumulated values for bigger areas. With grid-based data, more general predictions can be made regarding the target location, as there is no binding to a certain locality.\\

Another interesting point is, that the works that forecast weather related time series all used grid-based data, though some of them also used station-based data to refine their forecasts. Among the papers that aimed for forecasting power or similar often only station-based data is used which leads to the assumption that less effort has been made in these fields, as it is still more complex to acquire grid-based data. However, there remains the possibility that station-based data is more suitable, even though this means a trade-off in terms of flexibility. Of course it is also possible that this has to do with the fact, that there is no grid-based power data available as this may harm privacy issues.\\
