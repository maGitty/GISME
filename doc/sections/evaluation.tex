\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:Evaluation}

This chapter provides information about the input data acquired from different sources, the methods that were used to forecast electricity load and other statistical methods and also evaluates them regarding performance and the quality of the output.\\
%In this chapter, the used methods will be evaluated and critically regarded considering their performance and the quality of their outputs.\\

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

%Of course choosing data sources as well as sorting and cleaning the data also requires a certain amount of time and effort. Thus it will be explained hereinafter how this has been done for the data used in this thesis.

\subsection{ECMWF}

The data used in this thesis originates from \acrshort{ecmwf}, which is a research institute that produces global numerical weather predictions and other data.\\
It is time series based and for each timestamp there is a 2-dimensional array referred to by longitude and latitude respectively.\\

It must be mentioned that, as the data used has been reanalysed, so the expected error is likely to be smaller than if working with real-time data.\\

As data parameters there are also longitude and latitude, where the longitude is chosen to be from 5.5 to 15.5 and the latitude from 47 to 55.5. As the resolution of the used grid is at 0.25Â°, this results in a total of 1435 grid points per timestamp. As the range of the data from \acrshort{ecmwf} extends from 2015/1/1 to 2019/3/31(TODO update), there is a total of 1551 days with each 12 timestamps due to the 2 hours frequency and thus 18612 timestamps. Considering that there is a value for each point in the grid and every timestamp, there are 26708220 values for each variable.\\

Plotting the data on a map results in a result as can be seen in \Cref{fig:0_2017010702_20190617161317} and \Cref{fig:maxvar4_maps}. In this case the temperature measured at 2 meters is visualized.\\

\label{fig:maxvar4_maps}%
\end{figure}

In order to reduce complexity, a shapefile of the \acrshort{nuts} dataset was used. The shapefile contains all countries in the EU. The shape of Germany was filtered from this data and each point in the dataset is checked whether it is within Germany or not. The result can be seen in \Cref{fig:isinDE}. The filtered map first is saved in a numpy.ndarray and then applied on the data to mask unwanted data visualized in \Cref{fig:t2m_maxvar_0_map_isin}.\\

\subsection{Load data}

Besides weather data used to refine the forecasting results, also historic load data was needed. Therefore data has been retained from Open Power System Data\footnote{\url{https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/}}. \Cref{fig:t2m_mean_2015010112_2018123112_24F} shows the distribution of loads over time with one point per day at 12 am UTC time. The color shows the mean temperature measured at 2 meters.\\

%Describe the data set you are using. Use appropriate visualization (\eg graphs, statistical summaries \etc) to help the reader get to know your data set.

%\Cref{tab:wvars} is an example table. Remember to use full sentences in your caption and explain everything one can see in the table there as well. You can of course also use a simpler format for your table.


\subsection{Population}

For further improvement and in order to figure out important point in the grid, population data for Germany has been  selected from Eurostat\footnote{\url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database}}.\\

\section{Programming part}
\label{sec:prog}

\subsection{Programming Language}

For the programming part, Python 3.6+ has been chosen, as there is a variety of libraries to process all used file formats and because it tends to be a time saving language, also for visualization.\\

\subsection{Documentation}

In regard to coding styles, especially when it comes to docstrings, the numpy conventions were used. The three major points for this were first, that it is a popular and often used style, then it is also a visually oriented style which means, that it is easy to read and last it is supported by several (TODO check which, sphinx?!) autodoc tools that create a HTML based documentation from existing source code with docstrings.\\
