\label{ch:Conclusion}

It needs to be clarified, that in contrast to most of the presented works, this thesis uses reanalysed data from \gls{ecmwf} as weather predictions which means, that the forecasts might behave differently from forecasts in other works as what here is assumed to be a weather forecast is more accurate than usually. This also means that results from this thesis may not exactly match results using the same procedure with real-time data.\\
