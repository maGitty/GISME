\chapter{Methodology}
\label{ch:methods}

%This chapter should introduce to the theoretical background of your thesis. Any method you use to obtain the results later should be introduced and explained. 

Using weather data from ECMWF Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\\
Using load data from \url{https://data.open-power-system-data.org/}.\\
First downloaded whole Datasets from 2006-2019, but as the load for germany is properly available since 2015, now reduced dataset to 2015-2019.\\
Also checked for non-existing values, only 2 last timestamps values for the load are missing.\\

\section{Method 1}

Maybe use Random Forests for variable selection as in Nicoles paper? \Parencite{Ludwig2015}\\

%This is an example for a simple equation without equation numbering.
%$$
%\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}
%$$

You can also use equation numbering if you need to refer to an equation later \eg \Cref{eq:ex1}.


\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{eq:ex1}
\end{equation}

Additionally, simple equations can be put inline with the text, for example, $x \in X$. Remember to set all variables in math font \ie all $x$, $i$ and so on.

\section{Method 2}
