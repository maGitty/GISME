\chapter{Methodology}
\label{ch:methods}

This chapter should introduce to the theoretical background of your thesis. Any method you use to obtain the results later should be introduced and explained. 

\section{Method 1}

This is an example for a simple equation without equation numbering.
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}
$$

You can also use equation numbering if you need to refer to an equation later \eg \Cref{eq:ex1}.


\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{eq:ex1}
\end{equation}

Additionally, simple equations can be put inline with the text, for example, $x \in X$. Remember to set all variables in math font \ie all $x$, $i$ and so on.

\section{Method 2}
