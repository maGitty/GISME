When it comes to weather based prediction of power, a lot of papers have been puplished. Some of them also used data from \acrshort{ecmwf}, but none of them had a focus on the aspect of grid-based data. So first of all it is important to filter out works that deal with grid-based data, as very often it is not directly mentioned.\\
