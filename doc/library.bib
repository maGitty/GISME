abstract = {The paper presents analysis of wind and solar data for the same geographical location. The wind speed data taken at ground level are calibrated to evaluate the resource available for a large wind turbine with a hub height of approximate 80m. The correlation of each resource data against the electricity load demand for an entire year is then calculated separately and selected results are documented. The combined availability of wind and solar source against the same electricity demand and the respective correlation are also studied confirming that there is a strong complementarity between the two resources although such level of complementarity depends profoundly upon the location. It is shown that a combined resource can effectively deliver energy to the electricity grid when load demand experiences peaks, hence strengthening the case for further integration of wind and solar sources with the electricity grid. The study used actual weather data reported for the Sydney Airport and electricity load for New South Wales, Australia. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Electricity demand forecasting is becoming an essential tool for energy management, maintenance scheduling and investment decisions in the future liberalized energy markets and fluctuating fuel prices. To address these needs, appropriate forecasting tools for the electricity demand in Greece have been developed and tested. Electricity demand depends on economic variables and national circumstances as well as on climatic conditions. Following the analysis of the time series of electricity demand in the past decade, two statistical models have been developed, one providing daily and the other monthly demand predictions, to estimate medium term demand up to 12 months ahead, utilizing primitive (relative humidity) and derived (heating and cooling degree-days) meteorological parameters. Autoregressive structures were incorporated in both models, aiming at reducing serial correlation, which appears to bias the estimated effects of meteorological parameters on electricity demand. Both modeling approaches show a high predictive value with adjusted R2 above 96{\%}. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this paper. The effect of the climatic conditions on the electricity demand is then further investigated via predictions under four different scenarios for the weather conditions of the coming year, which include both normal and recently observed extreme behavior. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigate whether increasing cycling activity affects the emergence of new local businesses. Historical amenity data from OpenStreetMap is used to quantify change in shop and sustenance amenity counts. We apply an instrumental variable framework to investigate a causal relationship and to account for endogeneity in the model. Measures of cycling infrastructure serve as instruments. The impact is evaluated on the level of 4835 Lower Super Output Areas in Greater London. Our results indicate that an increase in cycling trips significantly contributes to the emergence of new local shops and businesses. Limitations regarding data quality, zero-inflation and residual spatial autocorrelation are discussed. While our findings correspond to previous investigations stating positive economic effects of cycling, we advance research in the field by providing a new dataset of unprecedented high granularity and size. Furthermore, this is the first study in cycling research looking at business amenities as a measure of economic activity. The insights from our analysis can enhance understandings of how cycling affects the development of local urban economies and may thus be used to assess and evaluate transport policies and investments. Beyond this, our study highlights the value of open data in city research.},

For this purpose, we analyze rental data of a major carsharing provider in the city of Amsterdam in combination with points of interest (POIs). The spatio-temporal demand variations are used to develop pricing zones for existing business areas. We then apply the influence of POIs derived from carsharing usage in Amsterdam in order to predict carsharing demand in the city of Berlin. The results indicate that predicted and actual usage patterns are very similar. Hence, our approach can be used to define new business areas when expanding to new cities to include high demand areas and exclude low demand areas, thereby reducing the risk of supply-demand imbalance.},

They are required for optimising a wide range of potential network solutions on the low voltage (LV) grid, including the integration of low carbon technologies (such as photovoltaics) and the utilisation of battery storage devices. Despite the need for accurate LV level load forecasts, much of the literature has focused on the individual household or building level using data from smart meters, or on aggregates of such data. This study provides a detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for both point and probabilistic LV load forecasts. We evaluate the out-of-sample forecast accuracies of these methodologies on 100 real LV feeders, for horizons from one to four days ahead. In addition, we also test the effect of the temperature (both actual and forecast) on the accuracy of load forecasts. We present some important results on the drivers of forecasts accuracy as well as on the empirical comparison of point and probabilistic forecast measures.},

Tapping the source of ‘Big Data' requires powerful algorithms combined with a strong understanding of the data used. One of the key challenges in predictive analytics is the identification of relevant factors that may explain the variables of interest. In this paper, we present a case study in predictive analytics in which we focus on the selection of relevant exogenous variables. More specifically, we attempt to predict the German electricity spot prices with reference to historical prices and a deep set of weather variables. In order to choose the relevant weather stations, we use the least absolute shrinkage selection operation (LASSO) and random forests to implicitly execute a variable selection. Overall, in our case study of German weather data, we manage to improve forecasting accuracy by up to 16.9{\%} in terms of mean average error.},

abstract = {Energy demand depends on outdoor temperature in a 'u' shaped fashion. Various studies have used this temperature dependence to investigate the effects of climate change on energy demand. Such studies contain implicit or explicit assumptions to describe expected socio-economic changes that may affect future energy demand. This paper critically analyzes these implicit or explicit assumptions and their possible effect on the studies' outcomes. First we analyze the interaction between the socio-economic structure and the temperature dependence pattern (TDP) of energy demand. We find that socio-economic changes may alter the TDP in various ways. Next we investigate how current studies manage these dynamics in socio-economic structure. We find that many studies systematically misrepresent the possible effect of socio-economic changes on the TDP of energy demand. Finally, we assess the consequences of these misrepresentations in an energy demand model based on temperature dependence and climate scenarios. Our model results indicate that expected socio-economic dynamics generally lead to an underestimation of future energy demand in models that misrepresent such dynamics. We conclude that future energy demand models should improve the incorporation of socio-economic dynamics. We propose dynamically modeling several key parameters and using direct meteorological data instead of degree days. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our model simulations suggest that warmer climate conditions in the US since 1982 slightly reduced carbon emissions in the US. Lower energy use associated with reduced heating requirements offsets higher fuel consumption to meet increased air-conditioning needs. The analysis also suggests that climate change policies should allow some variance in carbon emissions due to short-term weather variations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Wind and solar power have experienced rapid cost declines and are being deployed at scale. However, their output variability remains a key problem for managing electricity systems, and the implications of multi-day to multi-year variability are still poorly understood. As other energy-using sectors are electrified, the shape and variability of electricity demand will also change. We develop an open framework for quantifying the impacts of weather on electricity supply and demand using the Renewables.ninja and DESSTINEE models. We demonstrate this using a case study of Britain using National Grid's Two Degrees scenario forwards to 2030. We find the British electricity system is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, with peak demand rising above 70 GW due to electric heating, and intermittent renewable output exceeding demand as early as 2021. Hourly ramp-rates widen by 50{\%} and year-to-year variability increases by 80{\%}, showing why future power system studies must consider multiple years of data, and the influence of weather on both supply and demand. Our framework is globally applicable, and allows detailed scenarios of hourly electricity supply and demand to be explored using only limited input data such as annual quantities from government scenarios or broader energy systems models.},

abstract = {Currently, most PV (photovoltaic) modules are aligned in a way that maximizes annual yields. With an increasing number of PV installations, this leads to significant power peaks and could threaten energy policy objectives. Apparently sub-optimal inclinations and azimuth angles of PV plants on building roofs could counteract such tendencies by achieving significant temporal shifts in the electricity production. This paper addresses the potential of these counter-measures by evaluating the optimal regional mix of wind and PV installations with different mounting configurations in order to locally generate the annual electricity demand. It does so by adhering to three distinctive energy policy goals: economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and security of supply. The hourly yields of wind parks and nine PV orientations are simulated for four representative NUTS3-regions in Germany. These profiles are combined with regional electricity demand profiles and fed into an optimisation model. As a result, the optimal installed capacity for PV for every possible configuration - determined by inclination and azimuth angles - and the optimal installed capacity of wind power are obtained. The results indicate that the optimal mix differs significantly for each of the chosen goals, depending on regional conditions, but also shows a high transferability of general statements.},

abstract = {Albania is among the most vulnerable countries to external energy shocks and climatic conditions, because of its high dependency on hydropower for electricity. Given highly volatile international energy prices and expected global warming, it is becoming increasingly important to manage the demand for electricity. However, the country has long been faced with a significant problem of electricity metering. About one-third of total energy is lost for technical and nontechnical reasons. This paper estimates the residential demand function by applying a two-stage system equation method for an endogenous censored variable, because the lack of metering makes the electricity consumption partially observable for the econometrician. It is found that metering is important to curb non-essential electricity use by households. The electricity demand could also be reduced by raising the first block rate and lowering the second block rate and the threshold between the two blocks. In addition, weather conditions and home appliance ownership would affect the demand for electricity. But the latter looks more influential than the former.},

abstract = {To sustain perpetual operation, systems that harvest environmental energy must carefully regulate their usage to satisfy their demand. Regulating energy usage is challenging if a system's demands are not elastic and its hardware components are not energy-proportional, since it cannot precisely scale its usage to match its supply. Instead, the system must choose when to satisfy its energy demands based on its current energy reserves and predictions of its future energy supply. In this paper, we explore the use of weather forecasts to improve a system's ability to satisfy demand by improving its predictions. We analyze weather forecast, observational, and energy harvesting data to formulate a model that translates a weather forecast to a wind or solar energy harvesting prediction, and quantify its accuracy. We evaluate our model for both energy sources in the context of two different energy harvesting sensor systems with inelastic demands: a sensor testbed that leases sensors to external users and a lexicographically fair sensor network that maintains steady node sensing rates. We show that using weather forecasts in both wind- and solar-powered sensor systems increases each system's ability to satisfy its demands compared with existing prediction strategies.},

A better understanding of the link between climate and energy demand responses is crucial to improve energy forecasting outcomes and to evaluate the potential of climate change adaptation strategies. This paper reviews models of residential energy demand to temperature. We classify the models used in papers published in peer-reviewed journals and observe that the credibility of energy demand projections hinges in part on the assumption that the shape and type of the temperature response function is stationary. The evidence of acclimatization to warmer conditions may oppose this assumption. While the studies reviewed here only tested the impact of changes in the temperature thresholds and the shape of temperature response functions, a comprehensive understanding of changes in energy demand patterns and climate adaptation potentials requires knowledge of building stock turnover rates and associated changes in technology and behavioral responses of building occupants. These are not yet part of the standard repertoire of temperature-based demand models.},
