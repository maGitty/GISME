abstract = {This report was produced by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the World Bank Group's Global Expert Team for Adaptation. It was conceived following a brainstorming discussion on the subject “Sustainable Energy Sup- ply, Energy Access and Climate Change” hosted by ESMAP on October 26?27, 2009, and a? ended by 17 external specialists renowned for their work on development, energy, and climate change. This meeting challenged ESMAP to go beyond its work on climate mitigation in energy systems, and build upon and expand its pilot program on energy sector vulnerability to climate change to be? er understand and help inform operational teams on potential climate impacts and options for their management. This report is intended as an up-to-date compendium of what is known about weath- er variability and projected climate trends and their impacts on energy service provision and demand. It discusses emerging practices and tools for managing these impacts and integrating climate considerations into planning processes and operational practices in an environment of uncertainty. It draws on published, peer-reviewed literature. This report has been compiled to raise awareness of potential climate impacts and stress points on the energy sector. The target audiences are policy makers and energy planners},

abstract = {Short term load forecasts will play a key role in the implementation of smart electricity grids. They are required for optimising a wide range of potential network solutions on the low voltage (LV) grid, including the integration of low carbon technologies (such as photovoltaics) and the utilisation of battery storage devices. Despite the need for accurate LV level load forecasts, much of the literature has focused on the individual household or building level using data from smart meters, or on aggregates of such data. This study provides a detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for both point and probabilistic LV load forecasts. We evaluate the out-of-sample forecast accuracies of these methodologies on 100 real LV feeders, for horizons from one to four days ahead. In addition, we also test the effect of the temperature (both actual and forecast) on the accuracy of load forecasts. We present some important results on the drivers of forecasts accuracy as well as on the empirical comparison of point and probabilistic forecast measures.},

abstract = {Energy demand depends on outdoor temperature in a 'u' shaped fashion. Various studies have used this temperature dependence to investigate the effects of climate change on energy demand. Such studies contain implicit or explicit assumptions to describe expected socio-economic changes that may affect future energy demand. This paper critically analyzes these implicit or explicit assumptions and their possible effect on the studies' outcomes. First we analyze the interaction between the socio-economic structure and the temperature dependence pattern (TDP) of energy demand. We find that socio-economic changes may alter the TDP in various ways. Next we investigate how current studies manage these dynamics in socio-economic structure. We find that many studies systematically misrepresent the possible effect of socio-economic changes on the TDP of energy demand. Finally, we assess the consequences of these misrepresentations in an energy demand model based on temperature dependence and climate scenarios. Our model results indicate that expected socio-economic dynamics generally lead to an underestimation of future energy demand in models that misrepresent such dynamics. We conclude that future energy demand models should improve the incorporation of socio-economic dynamics. We propose dynamically modeling several key parameters and using direct meteorological data instead of degree days. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forest site productivity maps can be of great help for sustainable forest management. Site productivity maps, commonly representing the site index (SI) of a specific tree species, allow foresters to forecast wood production over the entire area of interest and hence select the most appropriate location for establishing a particular tree species mix. In many situations, forest SI cannot be directly measured from the dominant height and age of a stand and must therefore be directly estimated from relevant local site factors related to climate, topography and/or soil (attribute-based approach). Alternatively, estimations can also be made based on site information available for nearby locations (location-based approach). Also both approaches can be combined (hybrid approach). Since there is no straightforward procedure for selecting the most appropriate approach, the performance of five regionalization techniques was compared for predictive mapping of the SI of two important tree species in the temperate lowland region of Flanders (Belgium): one location-based technique (ordinary kriging), one attribute-based technique (regression) and three hybrid techniques (geomatching, ordinary co-kriging and regression kriging). From the findings of this case study, it cannot be concluded that one technique outperforms the others under all circumstances, but it was possible to build a decision tree providing guidance in selecting an appropriate SI mapping technique depending on the availability and characteristics of the data. ? 2012 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

An efficient use of the fluctuating energy output of photovoltaic (PV) systems requires reliable forecast information.

This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods used to forecast solar irradiance in order to facilitate selection of the appropriate forecast method according to needs. The study starts with a presentation of statistical approaches and techniques based on cloud images. Next numerical weather prediction or NWP models are detailed before discussing hybrid models.

Historical amenity data from OpenStreetMap is used to quantify change in shop and sustenance amenity counts. We apply an instrumental variable framework to investigate a causal relationship and to account for endogeneity in the model. Measures of cycling infrastructure serve as instruments. The impact is evaluated on the level of 4835 Lower Super Output Areas in Greater London. Our results indicate that an increase in cycling trips significantly contributes to the emergence of new local shops and businesses. Limitations regarding data quality, zero-inflation and residual spatial autocorrelation are discussed. While our findings correspond to previous investigations stating positive economic effects of cycling, we advance research in the field by providing a new dataset of unprecedented high granularity and size. Furthermore, this is the first study in cycling research looking at business amenities as a measure of economic activity. The insights from our analysis can enhance understandings of how cycling affects the development of local urban economies and may thus be used to assess and evaluate transport policies and investments. Beyond this, our study highlights the value of open data in city research.},

abstract = {Currently, most PV (photovoltaic) modules are aligned in a way that maximizes annual yields. With an increasing number of PV installations, this leads to significant power peaks and could threaten energy policy objectives. Apparently sub-optimal inclinations and azimuth angles of PV plants on building roofs could counteract such tendencies by achieving significant temporal shifts in the electricity production. This paper addresses the potential of these counter-measures by evaluating the optimal regional mix of wind and PV installations with different mounting configurations in order to locally generate the annual electricity demand. It does so by adhering to three distinctive energy policy goals: economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and security of supply. The hourly yields of wind parks and nine PV orientations are simulated for four representative NUTS3-regions in Germany. These profiles are combined with regional electricity demand profiles and fed into an optimisation model. As a result, the optimal installed capacity for PV for every possible configuration - determined by inclination and azimuth angles - and the optimal installed capacity of wind power are obtained. The results indicate that the optimal mix differs significantly for each of the chosen goals, depending on regional conditions, but also shows a high transferability of general statements.},

abstract = {This research paper aims to develop a hybrid neuro-evolutionary wrapper-based model for daily global solar radiation estimation in the solar-rich Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary-type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)-ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific utility in renewable energy applications.},

abstract = {Wave energy resources are intermittent and variable over both spatial and temporal scales. This is of concern when considering the supply of power to the electricity grid. This paper investigates whether deploying arrays of devices across multiple spatially separated sites can reduce intermittency of supply and step changes in generated power, thereby smoothing the contribution of wave energy to power supply. The primary focus is on the southwest UK; SWAN wave model hindcast data are analysed to assess the correlation of the resource across multiple sites and the variability of power levels with wave directionality. Power matrices are used to calculate step changes in the generated power with increasing numbers of sites. This is extended to national and European scales using ECMWF hindcast data to analyse the impacts of generating power at multiple sites over wider areas. Results show that at all scales the step change in generated power and the percentage of time with zero generation decreases with increasing numbers of sites before plateauing. This has positive implications for performance of electricity grids with high levels of renewable penetration.},

abstract = {Air temperature is an effective predictor for electricity demand, especially during hot periods where the need of electric air conditioning can be high. This paper presents for the first time an assessment of the use of seasonal climate forecasts of temperature for medium-term electricity demand prediction. The retrospective seasonal climate forecasts provided by ECWMF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) are used to forecast the June-July Italian electricity demand for the period 1990-2007.We find a relationship between summer (June-July) average temperature patterns over Europe and Italian electricity demand using both a linear and non-linear regression approach. With the aim to evaluate the potential usefulness of the information contained into the climate ensemble forecast, the analysis is extended considering a probabilistic approach.Results show that, especially in the Center-South of Italy, seasonal forecasts of temperature issued in May lead to a significant correlation coefficient of electricity demand greater than 0.6 for the summer period. The average correlation obtained from seasonal forecasts is 0.53 for the temperature predicted in May and 0.19 for the predictions issued in April for the linear model, while the non-linear approach leads to the coefficients of 0.62 and 0.36 respectively. For the probabilistic approach, seasonal forecasts exhibit a positive and significant skill-score in predicting the demand above/below the upper/lower tercile in many regions.This work is a significant progress in understanding the relationship between temperature and electricity demand. It is shown that much of the predictable electricity demand anomaly over Italy is connected with so-called heat-waves (i.e. long lasting positive temperature anomalies) over Europe.},

abstract = {To sustain perpetual operation, systems that harvest environmental energy must carefully regulate their usage to satisfy their demand. Regulating energy usage is challenging if a system's demands are not elastic and its hardware components are not energy-proportional, since it cannot precisely scale its usage to match its supply. Instead, the system must choose when to satisfy its energy demands based on its current energy reserves and predictions of its future energy supply. In this paper, we explore the use of weather forecasts to improve a system's ability to satisfy demand by improving its predictions. We analyze weather forecast, observational, and energy harvesting data to formulate a model that translates a weather forecast to a wind or solar energy harvesting prediction, and quantify its accuracy. We evaluate our model for both energy sources in the context of two different energy harvesting sensor systems with inelastic demands: a sensor testbed that leases sensors to external users and a lexicographically fair sensor network that maintains steady node sensing rates. We show that using weather forecasts in both wind- and solar-powered sensor systems increases each system's ability to satisfy its demands compared with existing prediction strategies.},

The combined availability of wind and solar source against the same electricity demand and the respective correlation are also studied confirming that there is a strong complementarity between the two resources although such level of complementarity depends profoundly upon the location. It is shown that a combined resource can effectively deliver energy to the electricity grid when load demand experiences peaks, hence strengthening the case for further integration of wind and solar sources with the electricity grid.

In this paper, ANN models are designed to produce intra-day solar forecasts using ground and exogenous data. Ground data were obtained from two measurement stations in Gran Canaria Island. In order to improve the results obtained with ground data, satellite GHI data (from Helioclim-3) as well as solar radiation and Total Cloud Cover forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used as additional inputs of the ANN model. It is shown that combining exogenous data (satellite and ECMWF forecasts) with ground data further improves the accuracy of the intra-day forecasts.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a spatial decision support system that assists free-floating carsharing providers in countering imbalances between vehicle supply and customer demand in existing business areas and reduces the risk of imbalance when expanding the carsharing business to a new city. For this purpose, we analyze rental data of a major carsharing provider in the city of Amsterdam in combination with points of interest (POIs). The spatio-temporal demand variations are used to develop pricing zones for existing business areas. We then apply the influence of POIs derived from carsharing usage in Amsterdam in order to predict carsharing demand in the city of Berlin. The results indicate that predicted and actual usage patterns are very similar. Hence, our approach can be used to define new business areas when expanding to new cities to include high demand areas and exclude low demand areas, thereby reducing the risk of supply-demand imbalance.},

abstract = {The efficient integration of wind in the energy market is limited by its natural variability and predictability. This limitation can be tackled by using the probabilistic predictions that provide accurate deterministic forecasts along with a quantification of their uncertainty. We propose as a novelty the application of an analog ensemble (AnEn) method to generate probabilistic wind power forecasts (WPF). The AnEn prediction of a given variable is constituted by a set of measurements of the past, concurrent to the past forecasts most similar to the current one. The AnEn performance for WPF is compared with three state-of-the-science methods for probabilistic predictions over a wind farm and a 505-day long period: a wind power prediction based on the ensemble wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (ECMWF-EPS), the Limited-area Ensemble Prediction System (LEPS) developed within the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO-LEPS) and a quantile regression (QR) technique. The AnEn performs as well as ECMWF-EPS, COSMO-LEPS and QR for common events while it exhibits more skill for rare events. A comparison with the performances obtained with a deterministic forecasting method based on a Neural Network is also carried out showing the benefits of using AnEn.},

abstract = {Electricity demand forecasting is becoming an essential tool for energy management, maintenance scheduling and investment decisions in the future liberalized energy markets and fluctuating fuel prices. To address these needs, appropriate forecasting tools for the electricity demand in Greece have been developed and tested. Electricity demand depends on economic variables and national circumstances as well as on climatic conditions. Following the analysis of the time series of electricity demand in the past decade, two statistical models have been developed, one providing daily and the other monthly demand predictions, to estimate medium term demand up to 12 months ahead, utilizing primitive (relative humidity) and derived (heating and cooling degree-days) meteorological parameters. Autoregressive structures were incorporated in both models, aiming at reducing serial correlation, which appears to bias the estimated effects of meteorological parameters on electricity demand. Both modeling approaches show a high predictive value with adjusted R2 above 96{\%}. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this paper. The effect of the climatic conditions on the electricity demand is then further investigated via predictions under four different scenarios for the weather conditions of the coming year, which include both normal and recently observed extreme behavior. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Albania is among the most vulnerable countries to external energy shocks and climatic conditions, because of its high dependency on hydropower for electricity. Given highly volatile international energy prices and expected global warming, it is becoming increasingly important to manage the demand for electricity. However, the country has long been faced with a significant problem of electricity metering. About one-third of total energy is lost for technical and nontechnical reasons. This paper estimates the residential demand function by applying a two-stage system equation method for an endogenous censored variable, because the lack of metering makes the electricity consumption partially observable for the econometrician. It is found that metering is important to curb non-essential electricity use by households. The electricity demand could also be reduced by raising the first block rate and lowering the second block rate and the threshold between the two blocks. In addition, weather conditions and home appliance ownership would affect the demand for electricity. But the latter looks more influential than the former.},

A better understanding of the link between climate and energy demand responses is crucial to improve energy forecasting outcomes and to evaluate the potential of climate change adaptation strategies. This paper reviews models of residential energy demand to temperature. We classify the models used in papers published in peer-reviewed journals and observe that the credibility of energy demand projections hinges in part on the assumption that the shape and type of the temperature response function is stationary. The evidence of acclimatization to warmer conditions may oppose this assumption. While the studies reviewed here only tested the impact of changes in the temperature thresholds and the shape of temperature response functions, a comprehensive understanding of changes in energy demand patterns and climate adaptation potentials requires knowledge of building stock turnover rates and associated changes in technology and behavioral responses of building occupants. These are not yet part of the standard repertoire of temperature-based demand models.},

Generally, forecasting models are trained using observed weather data while the trained models are applied for energy forecasting using forecasted weather data. In this study, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in the presence of weather predictors with uncertainty is assessed and compared. Accordingly, both observed and forecasted weather data are collected, then the influential predictors for solar PV generation forecasting model are selected using several measures. Using observed and forecasted weather data, an analysis on the uncertainty of weather variables is represented by MAE and bootstrapping. The energy forecasting model is trained using observed weather data, and finally, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in solar energy forecasting is simulated and compared for a real case study.},

For wind power, the study is conducted over a 2-year long period, with hourly data of the aggregated wind power output of the Sicily island. The 0-72 h wind predictions are generated with the limited-area Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), with boundary conditions provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) deterministic forecast. For solar irradiance, we consider daily data of the aggregated solar radiation energy output (based on the Kaggle competition dataset) over an 8-year long period. Numerical Weather Prediction data for the contest come from the National Oceanic {\&} Atmospheric Administration - Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) Reforecast Version 2. The PCA is applied to reduce the datasets dimension. A Neural Network (NN) and an Analog Ensemble (AnEn) post-processing are then applied on the PCA output to obtain the final forecasts. The study shows that combining PCA with these post-processing techniques leads to better results when compared to the implementation without the PCA reduction.},

abstract = {Solar energy production is steadily growing in several countries. Depending on meteorological variables such as solar irradiance, cloud cover and temperature, solar power production predictability is limited by the chaotic nature of these parameters. This work presents an application of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) to produce short-term probabilistic solar power forecasts (SPF). The EPS is based on running a meteorological model multiple times, starting from slightly perturbed initial conditions. The distribution of these different runs allows estimating the prediction uncertainty. We use about two years of power data from three solar farms located in different parts of Italy, characterized by different climatic conditions. We retrieve ensemble members of meteorological variables to build a power probability density function (PDF) for 0-72 h forecast horizons. A neural network (NN) is applied to reduce model bias and to generate a PDF of power starting from the ensemble of meteorological variables. Then two statistical methods are applied to calibrate further the ensemble of power predictions, which results in the final probabilistic power forecast. The first technique has been already tested for wind power forecasting (WPF), and it is based on estimating the variance deficit (VD) or "lack of spread" of the ensemble distribution. The second is a well-established method to calibrate probabilistic predictions based on Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS). Also, a persistence ensemble (PE) is used as a baseline technique. PE builds the ensemble members from the most recent power measurements available at the same lead time. It is shown that EPS coupled with VD and EMOS is a valid method to produce skillful probabilistic SPF in different climatic conditions. VD and EMOS show a similar level of statistical consistency and forecast skill for each test case. Overall, the performances of VD and EMOS appear significantly better than those of PE.},

abstract = {Wind and solar power have experienced rapid cost declines and are being deployed at scale. However, their output variability remains a key problem for managing electricity systems, and the implications of multi-day to multi-year variability are still poorly understood. As other energy-using sectors are electrified, the shape and variability of electricity demand will also change. We develop an open framework for quantifying the impacts of weather on electricity supply and demand using the Renewables.ninja and DESSTINEE models. We demonstrate this using a case study of Britain using National Grid's Two Degrees scenario forwards to 2030. We find the British electricity system is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, with peak demand rising above 70 GW due to electric heating, and intermittent renewable output exceeding demand as early as 2021. Hourly ramp-rates widen by 50{\%} and year-to-year variability increases by 80{\%}, showing why future power system studies must consider multiple years of data, and the influence of weather on both supply and demand. Our framework is globally applicable, and allows detailed scenarios of hourly electricity supply and demand to be explored using only limited input data such as annual quantities from government scenarios or broader energy systems models.},
